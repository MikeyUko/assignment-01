            <h2> IRON MAN </h2>

            <p> Since that first suit built in a cave, Tony has created dozens of new suits and upgrades
                over the years. However, throughout the 50-plus Iron Man models, there are common offensive
                and defense capabilities found in most iterations. </p>

            <p> The primary weapon contained within every suit, the repulsor rays use energy pulses to repel
                and disrupt enemies and are generated through the suit’s gauntlets. The suit’s booster jets
                enable Stark to fly fast enough to break the sound barrier, and maneuver more quickly than any fighter
                jet. </p>

            <p> Iron Man’s helmet provides Tony with a heads-up display that gives him 360-degree vision, access
                to information about his surroundings and enemies, and the ability to transmit and block transmissions
                along any frequency. The helmet also gives Tony a degree of resistance to EMP and psychic-based attacks.
            </p>

            <p> A weapon centered in Iron Man’s chest, the unibeam is capable of projecting dazzling light, and can also
                be used as a powerful force beam that is even more powerful than the repulsor ray. </p>
