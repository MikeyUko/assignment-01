            <p> Name: Tony Stark</p>
            <p> Age: 30 years old</p>
            <p> Hobbies: Blowing stuff up and protecting his universe</p>
            <p> Place of Origin: Brooklyn, New York, USA. </p>

            <p>
                Tony Stark is the wealthy son of industrialist and weapons manufacturer Howard Stark and his wife,
                Maria.
                Tony grew up a genius with a brilliant mind for technology and inventions and, naturally, followed in
                his father’s footsteps,
                inheriting Stark Industries upon his parents’ untimely death.
                Tony designed many weapons of war for Stark Industries, far beyond what any other company was creating,
                while living the lifestyle of a bon vivant.

                Fate would take a dark turn for Tony Stark once he decided to consult on a weapons contract overseas in
                enemy terrain.
                An improvised explosive device exploded underneath Tony’s transport, and he was brought to the brink of
                death..
            </p>
            <p>
                Awakening as a prisoner of the warlord Wong-Chu, Tony made a gruesome discovery:
                the explosion had sent a piece of shrapnel mere inches from his heart.
                It was only the timely intervention of fellow captive and engineer Yinsen that kept the shrapnel at bay.
                While held captive, and forced to work on weapons, Tony turned his near-death experience into
                inspiration.
                What if he could power an iron suit that would not only keep the shrapnel from killing Tony, but also
                help him to escape?
